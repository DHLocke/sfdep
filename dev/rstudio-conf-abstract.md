# rstudio::conf(2022L) abstract

## Abstract:

R has come quite a long way to enable spatial analysis over the past few years. Packages such as sf have made spatial analysis and mapping easier for many. However, adoption of R for spatial statistics and econometrics has been limited. Many spatial analysts, researchers, and practitioners lean on Python libraries such as pysal.

In this talk I briefly discuss my journey through spatial analysis and introduce a new package sfdep which provides a tidy interface to spatial statistics. sfdep is an interface to the underutilized spdep package as well as implements other common spatial statistics. sfdep provides functionality equivalent to that of Pysal's exploratory spatial data analysis library.

## Video submission

Name: Josiah Parry

Hi there, my name is Josiah Parry.

This talk titled Exploratory "Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis in the tidyverse"" i will discuss briefly what ESDA is and the current state of ESDA in the data science ecosystem through my own recent experience in graduate school. I will talk about the current tools available in R and the challenge that the typical R user faces. 

Following, I'll introduce attendees to a new R package "sfdep" and walk attendees through the basics of ESDA. Lastly, I'll compare it to the dominant python library pysal.

My hope is that attendees will walk away feeling that they do not have to learn a new programming language strictly for doing ESDA. That they feel confident in their abilities to pick up a new R package that fits within their current dplyr and sf workflow. And most importantly, to bolster to spatial toolset within the R community.

Why it's important:
What attendees will take away:
