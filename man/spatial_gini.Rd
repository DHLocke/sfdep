\title{Spatial Gini Index}
\usage{
spatial_gini(x, nb)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector without missing values}

\item{nb}{a neighbor list, for example created with \code{\link[=st_contiguity]{st_contiguity()}}}
}
\value{
A scalar numeric.
}
\description{
Calculates the spatial Gini index for a given numeric vector and neighbor list.
Based on the formula provided Rey and Smith (2013).
}
\details{
The Gini index is a global measure of inequality based on the Lorenz curve. It ranges between 0 and 1 where 0 is perfect equality and 1 is perfect inequality.

The spatial Gini index decomposes the Gini coefficient based on spatial neighbors.
